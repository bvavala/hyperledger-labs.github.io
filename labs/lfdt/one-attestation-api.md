# Lab Name
One Attestation API

# Short Description
This lab proposes to create a single API to handle remote attestations.
Attestations are a crucial mechanism to establish trust in hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs).
Today, multiple attestation mechanisms are available, like SGX-EPID (which is being phased out), SGX-DCAP, TDX-DCAP and SEV-attestation.
This proposal aims to create a single abstraction for the generation and verification of hardware-based attestations.
The abstraction can benefit, and avoid redundant implementations in, multiple projects (e.g., Fabric Private Chaincode, Private Data Objects) that use TEEs to enhance software integrity and confidentiality.

# Scope of Lab
The scope of the lab is to provide tools and support for hardware/software attestations.
Contributions from the community will help support additional attestation mechanisms and TEEs.
Initially, we anticipate to integrate this tool with: Fabric Private Chaincode and Private Data Objects.

# Pre-existing repository
Initially, this lab is meant to spin off the attestation API created in/for the Fabric Private Chaincode project.

Recently, the library was extended with DCAP support and partially integrated with the Hyperledger Labs Private Data Objects project.
